## Project Goals
With this project, I was introduced to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL">SQL</a>, a widely used language used for managing relational databases. SQL databases are often large and highly structured, and our classroom instruction focused on querying these datasets and producing tables from the results. This project focused on a set of employee data, and I was expected to design queries with specific outputs in mind.

## Tools and Solutions
I began the assignment by creating an <a href="https://github.com/sonder74/sql-challenge/blob/master/sql-challenge%20ERD.png">entity relationship diagram (ERD)</a> that modeled the different parts of the dataset and the connections they shared. I then joined the source CSV files together using <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostrgeSQL</a>, an open-source database system that allowed me to create SQL tables, perform queries, and save the results for viewing later. The project's bonus section involved a handful of additional tools, like <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>, <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">Pandas</a>, and <a href="https://matplotlib.org/">Matplotlib</a>.

## Outcomes and Lessons Learned
I succeeded in completing all of this project's SQL <a href="https://github.com/sonder74/sql-challenge/tree/master/SQL%20Queries">queries</a> and <a href="https://github.com/sonder74/sql-challenge/tree/master/SQL%20Views">views</a>, and I also tackled the bonus coding. You can check out the latter <a href="https://github.com/sonder74/sql-challenge/blob/master/sql-challenge-bonus.ipynb">here</a>.
